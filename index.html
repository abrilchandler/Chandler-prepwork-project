        <h2>My future programming ideas for apps</h2>
        <p>
            I have begun thinking of apps that I could begin learning to program for. Currently my most promising future project seems to be a barn manager available to horse trainers and clients. It will have many functions that I can't begin to remember but it is promising that I already have ideas regarding how to utilize the knowledge I will be gaining.
